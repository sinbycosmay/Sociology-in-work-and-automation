# Sociology-in-Work-and-Automation

The introduction of technology in the work force brought about a plethora of changes to the structure 
of work place as well as the society. We try to study contemporary liter- ature (Early 2000s), conduct case studies (2021) 
and understand the concepts of Marx, Taylor, Braverman, Zuboff et al. within the context and build a correlation between their works 
and its significance in the present scenario.
